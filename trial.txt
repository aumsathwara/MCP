Dancing Frog in the Rain

Emerald acrobat on lily pads,
Tiny webbed feet tap a joyful beat,
As raindrops fall from cloudy skies,
The frog begins his dancing feat.

Splish-splash, a twirl and hop,
Glistening skin in misty showers,
Nature's percussion sets the stage,
For amphibian ballet that spans hours.

He leaps with glee through puddle pools,
Croaking chorus to the rainfall's tune,
Each droplet a partner in this dance,
Under the silver glow of the moon.

No audience needed for his show,
Just the rhythm of the pattering rain,
In this moment of pure, wild delight,
The dancing frog feels no constraint.

So when you see rain start to fall,
Look close at ponds and streams nearby,
You might just catch a glimpse of it—
A dancing frog beneath the sky.
